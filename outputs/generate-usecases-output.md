- **Typical Flow**:
  1. User provides Docker Compose file or selects from templates
  2. System validates and processes compose configuration
  3. Creates isolated network for the application
  4. Deploys all services defined in compose file
  5. Configures inter-service communication
  6. Sets up domain routing for web services
- **Input/Output**: Docker Compose file → Multi-service application stack
- **Dependencies**: Docker Compose, Docker Swarm (for multi-node), Traefik
- **Example Scenario**: Deploying a microservices application with frontend, API, database, and cache services using Docker Compose.

## Secondary Use Cases (Medium Priority)

### Use Case #4: Template-Based One-Click Deployment
- **Category**: Template Deployment
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Frequency**: Medium (Monthly operations)
- **Description**: Deploy pre-configured open-source applications (Plausible, Pocketbase, Calcom, etc.) with a single click using template system.
