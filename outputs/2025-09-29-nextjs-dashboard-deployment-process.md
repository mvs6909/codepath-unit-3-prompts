# Research: NextJS Application Deployment Process via the Dashboard

**Date**: 2025-09-29 00:33:06 PDT
**Researcher**: Claude
**Git Commit**: ae24aa8be543a0b940763a3cbc5a0fa4b3542260
**Branch**: canary
**Repository**: dokploy

## Research Question
How does the NextJS application deployment process work through the Dokploy dashboard, including UI components, backend APIs, deployment workflows, Docker integration, and monitoring systems?

## Summary
Dokploy provides a comprehensive web-based platform for deploying NextJS applications through a sophisticated dashboard. The system features a modular React-based UI, tRPC-powered APIs, automated Docker containerization via Nixpacks, Docker Swarm orchestration, and real-time monitoring with WebSocket-based log streaming. The deployment flow supports multiple git providers, automatic webhooks, preview deployments, and enterprise-grade features like health monitoring and multi-channel notifications.

## Detailed Findings

### Frontend Dashboard Components

**Application Creation Flow**:
- `apps/dokploy/components/dashboard/project/add-application.tsx:AddApplication` - Main application creation form with validation
- `apps/dokploy/components/dashboard/project/add-template.tsx:AddTemplate` - Template-based deployment for pre-configured NextJS setups
- `apps/dokploy/pages/dashboard/project/[projectId]/services/application/[applicationId].tsx` - Comprehensive application management interface

**Build Configuration UI**:
- `apps/dokploy/components/dashboard/application/build/show.tsx:ShowBuildChooseForm` - Build type selection (Nixpacks recommended for NextJS)
- `apps/dokploy/components/dashboard/application/general/generic/show.tsx:ShowProviderForm` - Git provider configuration
- `apps/dokploy/components/dashboard/application/general/generic/save-github-provider.tsx:SaveGithubProvider` - GitHub integration with branch/path watching

**Deployment Controls**:
- `apps/dokploy/components/dashboard/application/general/show.tsx:ShowGeneralApplication` - Deploy, reload, rebuild actions with auto-deploy toggle

### Backend API Infrastructure

**Core API Layer**:
- `apps/dokploy/server/api/routers/application.ts` - tRPC router with endpoints: `create`, `deploy`, `redeploy`, `saveBuildType`, `saveGithubProvider`
- `packages/server/src/services/application.ts` - Service layer: `createApplication()`, `deployApplication()`, `deployRemoteApplication()`
- `packages/server/src/db/schema/application.ts` - Database schema supporting multiple build types and git providers

**Webhook Integration**:
- `apps/dokploy/pages/api/deploy/github.ts` - GitHub webhook handler for push/PR events
- `apps/dokploy/pages/api/deploy/[refreshToken].ts` - Generic git webhook endpoint
- Supports automatic deployments, preview environments, and branch/path filtering

### Docker & Container Orchestration

**Build Systems**:
- `packages/server/src/utils/builders/nixpacks.ts` - Primary NextJS builder with auto-detection
- `packages/server/src/utils/builders/index.ts:buildApplication()` - Orchestrates build process and container deployment
- `Dockerfile` & `Dockerfile.cloud` - Multi-stage NextJS builds with pnpm

**Container Management**:
- Uses **Docker Swarm** for service orchestration with rolling updates
- `packages/server/src/utils/traefik/application.ts` - Automatic Traefik reverse proxy configuration
- Health checks, resource limits, and automatic restart policies

### Deployment Workflow

**Queue System**:
- `apps/dokploy/server/queues/deployments-queue.ts` - BullMQ with Redis for job processing
- `packages/server/src/db/schema/deployment.ts` - Status tracking: `running`, `done`, `error`

**Build Process Flow**:
1. **Git Integration** → Clone from GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket/Gitea
2. **Build Execution** → Nixpacks auto-detects NextJS and creates optimized Docker image
3. **Container Deployment** → Docker Swarm service creation with health checks
4. **Service Registration** → Automatic Traefik routing and SSL certificate management

### Monitoring & Logging

**Real-time Monitoring**:
- `apps/dokploy/server/wss/listen-deployment.ts` - WebSocket deployment log streaming
- `apps/dokploy/server/wss/docker-container-logs.ts` - Live container log monitoring
- `packages/server/src/monitoring/utils.ts` - CPU, memory, I/O metrics collection

**Deployment Tracking**:
- `apps/dokploy/components/dashboard/application/deployments/show-deployments.tsx` - Real-time deployment status UI
- `apps/dokploy/components/dashboard/monitoring/free/container/show-free-container-monitoring.tsx` - Live performance charts

**Notification Systems**:
- `packages/server/src/utils/notifications/build-success.ts` & `build-error.ts` - Multi-channel alerts
- Supports Email, Discord, Slack, Telegram, Gotify notifications

## Code References

- `apps/dokploy/components/dashboard/project/add-application.tsx:1-200` - Application creation form
- `apps/dokploy/server/api/routers/application.ts:50-100` - Core deployment APIs
- `packages/server/src/utils/builders/nixpacks.ts:1-150` - NextJS build automation
- `packages/server/src/services/application.ts:200-300` - Deployment orchestration
- `apps/dokploy/server/wss/listen-deployment.ts:1-100` - Real-time log streaming
- `packages/server/src/utils/traefik/application.ts:1-200` - Reverse proxy configuration

## Architecture Insights

**Design Patterns**:
- **Modular UI Architecture**: Separate components for each deployment aspect (build, environment, domains)
- **API-First Design**: tRPC provides type-safe client-server communication
- **Queue-Based Processing**: Async deployment handling with job persistence
- **Container-Native**: Docker Swarm for high availability and scaling
- **GitOps Integration**: Webhook-driven deployments with preview environments

**NextJS Optimizations**:
- **Nixpacks Auto-Detection**: Automatically configures optimal Node.js environment
- **Static Export Support**: Handles SSG deployments via `publishDirectory` configuration
- **Environment Injection**: Build-time and runtime variable management
- **Asset Optimization**: Proper handling of `.next`, `dist`, and `public` directories

**Enterprise Features**:
- **Multi-Server Support**: Deploy to remote servers via SSH
- **Preview Deployments**: Automatic staging environments for pull requests
- **Rollback System**: Built-in deployment rollback capabilities
- **Resource Monitoring**: Real-time performance tracking and alerting

## Historical Context

This research represents the current state of Dokploy's NextJS deployment capabilities as of commit `ae24aa8be543a0b940763a3cbc5a0fa4b3542260` on the `canary` branch. The platform demonstrates a mature approach to containerized application deployment with enterprise-grade features.

## Open Questions

1. **Scaling Strategy**: How does the system handle high-volume deployments and concurrent builds?
2. **Database Migration**: How are NextJS applications with database dependencies managed during deployments?
3. **Performance Optimization**: What caching strategies are employed for faster subsequent deployments?
4. **Security Boundaries**: How are secrets and environment variables secured across the deployment pipeline?
